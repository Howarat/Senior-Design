# Austin Howard-Clark: Individual Capstone Assessment
## Introduction
In choosing a topic for my senior-design project, I hoped to find something that would interest me at all times of the day. Something that would muddle around in my head for hours on end as I continually thought of new ways to design and implement the topic into my project. I also wanted to apply things I have learned from my experiences in life; from my first day in college to the hardest exams I have taken, from my first 5 nervous minutes of working in an office setting to all of my co-workers knowing my name. After countless hours pondering topics and ideas, a project idea was created. With Arcadio, my time spent at UC and through co-op would be joined. This project will test all areas of my education as I construct, program, and tinker away in creating something truly useful to anyone interested in video game development. The project will challenge me to implement my ideas, and to use my resources in it's creation. This project will be completed solo, as I believe that I should not rely on others to demonstrate what I have learned since graduating high school.
