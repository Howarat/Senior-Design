### Project Topic Area:
* Game Development Testing Platform

### Project Abstract:
* Game development is a growing field among younger developers who frequently play video games in their free time. When learning new devs typically start by creating 2D games that have been made before; Snake, Pac-Man, Tetris, Brick Breaker. Once a new dev has created their game, it is often an issue of showing it off to others. With Arcadio, you can easily map controls and import your newly made game into a flashy arcade cabinet. This product allows aspiring game developers to maintain morale that is typically lost after creating a game due to the lack of an interface to play and test the game on.

### Inadequacy of Current Solutions to Problem:
* Once made, games are often misplaced and not easily accesible for showing others what the developer has created.
* With most beginner projects being 2D arcade style games, they feel unnatural being played on a desktop/laptop.
* There is no current method of easily showing off a collection of games a developer has created.

### Background Skills/Interests Applicable to Problem:
* I have worked on developing video games as a personal hobby. While trying to show others games I have created, I am often disheartened as they lose interest before the game is launched. I am very interested in being able to quickly draw others attention to games I have created when they come over, and to have a more natural platform available to test the games on. 

### Project Team Approach to Problem:
* Being a solo project, I will approach this problem by creating a physical arcade platform for developers to test and show off games they have made on. The platform will have the usual arcade components (bumpers, joysticks, flashing LEDs, coin opt) and will host a local web interface to upload games to and set their controls.
