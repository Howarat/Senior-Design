# Major Constraints
## Economic Cost
The budget of the project will be around $400. This is needed to cover the cost of the Raspberry Pi 4 8GB, Arduino, sensors, arcade components, and materials needed for the frame. Hardware needed for the construction and develop of the project was already owned prior and consists of a PC, cardboard box, and soldering iron workstation. 
# Time
With a deadline of April 2021, time is a major constraint on the success of this project. Less time will be available to prototype the project, and add features while still being able to work out bugs along the way. Other classes will continue during the semester as well, making time management crucial. The goal is to work on the project for 8-12 hours each week/weekend during the Spring 2021 semester. This will provide adequate time to test the machine and fix any major bugs.
# Scope
Being a solo project the scope has been determined by what I found to be achievable. Additional features are planned and some may be trimmed as time allows. With me being the sole member, the entire projects creation will depend on my time management skills and available time to spend developing.
# Professional/Technical Expertise
This project will require several areas of expertise to be sucessful. With no expert to consult, I will research the needed information to construct a working project. Knowledge of the Linux OS, Web Development, Basic Electronics, and Scripting will be necessary to complete the "Arcadio". Research will also need to be done regarding arcade components and how to use them alongside an arduino and Raspberry Pi 4.

# Ethical/ Legal
No user information is stored other than a single game file uploaded by the user. All code used within the project will be free for anyone to use, including an image of the final project, the scripts running on the pi for Arcadio, and all code running the web interface.
# Security
The "Arcadio" host a local webpage which will only be accessible on the configured network The raspberry pi running the web server and handling the I/O from the sensors will be as secure as the network it is setup on. All data is stored on the Raspberry Pi's MicroSD card locally. This project will have no privacy issues or concerns regarding it as malware.
# Social
All code written as part of the project as well as instructions on creating the frame and wiring of the project are free to download, modify, and redistribute. The project will be aimed at game devs who want an open source hardware project that will aid in the testing of their 2D games.
# Environmental
The project is very specific to the cabinet in which it is built. Therefore you must construct your own project using the guidelines laid out in (Insert Instructions.md). The environment was not harmed in the creation of this project. but does consume energy potentially from fossil fuels. 
# Diversity and Cultural Impact
The finished project will have a retro gaming theme to it, and will mostly appeal to anyone who is interested in game development, web development, or who enjoys arcade machines. The application will only be available in the English language.
