# Milestones

### 1. Determine scope and design of project
Map out what Arcadio will consists of. Create mock ups of the physical cabinet and web interface. Determine what features the device will have.
### 2. Research and purchase parts needed for prototype
Purchase the needed parts after researching requirements needed for 2D gaming and web hosting. Minimum of Computer/Web Server and device to send input from arcade components. (Later decided on Raspberry Pi 4 8GB and Arduino Mega duo)
### 3. Set up Raspberry Pi 4 as web server (LAMP)
Set up server on Raspberry Pi 4 with a Linux OS, with APACE, MySQL, and PHP for additional dynamic content on web.
### 4. Create working prototype of webpage
Program and develop a web page that will allow users to upload their games to the Raspberry Pi 4, restarting and launching game after hitting confirm.
### 5. Purchase sensors/arcade components
Purchase the components/parts needed to create a working prototype of the projects internals.
### 6. Create working prototype of sensor input 
Design and create a working prototype of the sensor input on a cardboard box before moving into future Arcadio frame
### 7. Program sensor input to games via webpage
Program sensor input controls in webpage to allow users to make adjustments
### 8. Purchase materials for Arcadio frame
Purchase all wood/acrylic needed to construct the frame.
### 9. Construct Arcadio frame
Build the frame using the acquired materials.
### 10. Attach components inside of Arcadio, wire up
Install all internals to Arcadio cabinet. Ensure all wiring remains consistent from prototype, and manage wires properly.
### 11. Test Arcadio and make fixes
Test with several games of varying control styles, note any bugs and work on fixing them. Polish project before having another user test. Update all documentation for project with photos, scripts, and code running behind the webpage.
### 12. Have someone test Arcadio
Have a user test Arcadio by uploading a game to the device via the web interface. Have the user test the coin operator to play and write down all feedback.
### 13. Make finishing touches
Based on feedback work on fixing bugs seen in Arcadio. Add/Remove features as determined by test and polish project to a final state.
